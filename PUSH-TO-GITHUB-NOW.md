# 🚀 Ready to Push to GitHub!

## Current Status ✅

- ✅ Tutorial files committed
- ✅ Local repository ready
- ✅ Remote configured: `https://github.com/chamnabmeyinfo/s3vgroup-website.git`

## Next Step: Push Your Code

Run this command to push your local code to GitHub:

```powershell
git push -u origin main --force
```

**What this does:**
- Uploads your current local code to GitHub
- Replaces everything on GitHub with your local version
- Sets up tracking so future pushes are easier

**⚠️ Note:** The `--force` flag is needed because GitHub has different commits. This will replace GitHub's history with yours.

## After Pushing

1. **Verify Upload**: Visit https://github.com/chamnabmeyinfo/s3vgroup-website
2. **Check Files**: Make sure all your files are there
3. **Deploy to cPanel**: Follow instructions in `GITHUB-DEPLOYMENT-TUTORIAL.md`
